# Automated Portfolio Optimization

## Project Description
This project designs an algorithmic trading strategy that combines Bitcoin with traditional assets to build risk-adjusted, high-return portfolios. By leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s low market correlation and applying machine learning techniques, we optimize asset allocation to enhance returns while managing volatility. The goal is to provide a data-driven framework for resilient portfolio construction, supporting smarter investment decisions in evolving markets.

## Diversified Portfolio
Three asset categories: Growth (Bitcoin, QQQ), Hedging (Gold, BND),  Stable Income (SCHV)

## Core Strategy Approach

Our methodology harnesses Bitcoin's asymmetric upside while systematically managing its inherent volatility through a multi-layered approach. The framework combines:

1. Growth Component: Strategic Bitcoin allocation to capture its disproportionate return potential
2. Stability Mechanism: Carefully selected hedging instruments and yield-producing assets to dampen volatility
3. Diversification Protocol: Thoughtful integration with uncorrelated traditional assets to enhance portfolio robustness

We implement sophisticated machine learning techniques including temporal pattern recognition (LSTM networks) and ensemble decision models (Random Forests) to dynamically optimize allocations. This creates an adaptive system that continuously balances growth opportunities with risk mitigation across market regimes.

The foundation of this approach rests on empirical evidence demonstrating Bitcoin's unique portfolio diversification benefits when combined with traditional assets under rigorous quantitative frameworks. Our implementation focuses particularly on maintaining liquidity while achieving superior risk-adjusted performance metrics.

This produces a nimble yet disciplined investment architecture capable of navigating crypto's characteristic volatility while participating in its growth potential.
